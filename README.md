# Welcome to Splatr

Splatr was born out of many a late-night brainstorming sessions between a bunch of writers who wanted a way to share creativity with communities of artists while helping to ease the major headaches and complexities.

With Splatr, our goal is to build a platform where human artists can promote and support themselves through commissions. We take care of all the backend boring bits (payment processing, web-hosting, marketing, blah, blah, blah) so you can focus on what you enjoy most - making art!

This is going to be a long journey, but one we hope people will enjoy and help us on.
